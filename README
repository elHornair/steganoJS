SteganoJS was built for a class on parallel computing at the School of Applied Science in Zurich, Switzerland.
The app let's you hide a secret text or a secret image in a container image. It uses web workers to do so in an efficient way. The hidden information is saved in the least significant bit of the container image.
The concept of hiding information in a container is fairly old (the ancient greeks already applied it) and is called Steganography- Hence the name SteganoJS.
